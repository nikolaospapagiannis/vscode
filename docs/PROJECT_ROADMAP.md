# VS Code ExAI Project Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the development plan for the VS Code ExAI project, which combines advanced AI capabilities with context-aware programming assistance through the Multi-Provider Framework and Recursive Chain-of-Thought (CRCT) system.

## Core Development (v1)

### 1. Multi-Provider Framework

The Multi-Provider Framework serves as the foundation for integrating various AI providers into VS Code:

- Provider abstraction layer for consistent API
- Provider registration and discovery system
- Request handling and routing
- Streaming response support
- Error handling and retry mechanisms

**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED

### 2. CRCT Core Implementation

The Recursive Chain-of-Thought system provides structured context management and dependency tracking:

- Hierarchical key management for files and directories
- Dependency grid with RLE compression
- Tracker file I/O in Markdown format
- Phase management (Setup, Strategy, Execution)
- Cache and batch processing systems

**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED

### 3. CRCT Visualization and Interaction Layer

The visualization layer provides intuitive user interfaces for interacting with the CRCT system:

- Interactive dependency graph visualization
- Command palette integration
- Status bar indicators
- Context menu extensions
- Progress reporting

**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED

## Current Development Priority

### 4. VS Code Extension Integration

Integrate the core components into a fully functional VS Code extension:

- Extension packaging and publishing setup
- Configuration and settings implementation
- Activation and lifecycle management
- Performance optimization for production use
- Cross-platform testing and validation
- User documentation and help system

**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS

### 5. Testing and Stabilization

Comprehensive testing and stabilization of the core components:

- Unit test coverage for all core modules
- Integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- Performance benchmarking and optimization
- Error handling and recovery improvements
- User experience refinement

**Status**: ðŸ“… PLANNED

## Future Enhancements (v2)

### 6. AI Integration Layer

The AI Integration Layer bridges CRCT and AI providers for enhanced contextual intelligence:

- Context building using dependency information
- Provider-specific adapters
- AI strategy controllers for different tasks
- Prompt engineering and optimization
- Request pipeline with middleware support
- Response transformation and formatting

**Status**: ðŸ“… PLANNED (v2)

### 7. Semantic Analysis Engine

The Semantic Analysis Engine will provide deeper code understanding beyond structural dependencies:

- Language-specific code parsing
- Semantic relationship detection
- Type inference and tracking
- Control and data flow analysis
- Symbol resolution and reference tracking

**Status**: ðŸ“… PLANNED (v2)

### 8. Collaborative Intelligence Framework

The Collaborative Intelligence Framework will enable team-based AI assistance:

- Shared context and dependency information
- Team-based learning and adaptation
- Project-specific knowledge capture
- Permission and privacy controls
- Collaborative editing with AI assistance

**Status**: ðŸ“… PLANNED (v2)

### 9. Workspace Insights Dashboard

The Workspace Insights Dashboard will provide analytics on codebase structure and AI interactions:

- Dependency visualization and metrics
- Code complexity analysis
- AI usage statistics and impact assessment
- Refactoring recommendations
- Project health indicators

**Status**: ðŸ“… PLANNED (v2)

## Development Priorities

1. **Usable MVP**: Deliver a functional core extension before adding enhancements
2. **Stability**: Ensure robust performance across different environments
3. **User Experience**: Focus on intuitive and seamless integration with VS Code
4. **Documentation**: Provide clear user and developer documentation
5. **Performance**: Optimize for large codebases and real-time interactions

## Success Metrics for v1 Release

- Successful installation and activation on all supported platforms
- Consistent performance with large codebases (>100K LOC)
- Clear visualization of code dependencies
- Intuitive user interface for CRCT operations
- Comprehensive documentation for users and developers

## Next Steps

1. Complete the extension packaging and configuration
2. Implement settings and preferences management
3. Create user documentation and help system
4. Develop automated tests for core components
5. Perform cross-platform testing and validation
6. Prepare for VS Code Marketplace publication
