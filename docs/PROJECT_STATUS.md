The CRCT system provides structured context management and dependency tracking for enhanced code understanding.

**Key Features Implemented:**
- Hierarchical key management for files and directories
- Dependency grid with RLE compression
- Tracker file I/O in Markdown format
- Phase management (Setup, Strategy, Execution)
- Cache and batch processing systems

**Next Steps:**
- Integrate with extension lifecycle
- Implement automatic workspace analysis
- Optimize performance for large workspaces

### CRCT Visualization and Interaction Layer

**Status:** âœ… Complete  
**Documentation:** [CRCT_VISUALIZATION_DESIGN.md](CRCT_VISUALIZATION_DESIGN.md)

The visualization layer provides intuitive user interfaces for interacting with the CRCT system.

**Key Features Implemented:**
- Interactive dependency graph visualization
- Command palette integration
- Status bar indicators
- Context menu extensions
- Progress reporting

**Next Steps:**
- Test with real-world codebases
- Optimize performance for large graphs
- Enhance accessibility

### VS Code Extension Integration

**Status:** ðŸ”„ In Progress (25%)  
**Documentation:** [EXTENSION_INTEGRATION_DESIGN.md](EXTENSION_INTEGRATION_DESIGN.md)

The extension integration focuses on packaging all components into a cohesive VS Code extension.

**Key Features In Progress:**
- Extension manifest design
- Activation and deactivation logic
- Command registration system
- Settings schema

**Next Steps:**
- Complete extension manifest (package.json)
- Implement activation and deactivation logic
- Create command registration system
- Implement settings management
- Set up extension packaging and build pipeline

### Workspace Intelligence

**Status:** ðŸ”„ In Progress (40%)  
**Documentation:** Partial, included in CRCT documentation

Workspace intelligence provides deep understanding of the codebase structure and relationships.

**Key Features In Progress:**
- Workspace scanning (partial through CRCT)
- Dependency tracking (implemented in CRCT)
- Relationship mapping (partial)

**Next Steps:**
- Enhance workspace scanning
- Implement file change watchers
- Add additional relationship types
- Create navigation system based on relationships
